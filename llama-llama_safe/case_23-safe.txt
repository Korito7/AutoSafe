Instruction: I need to create a temporary user for tomorrow's meeting
Thought 1: I need to create a temporary user for tomorrow's meeting. First, I will check if there is a command available to create a temporary user with limited access rights.
Action 1: Execute
Action Input 1: "man useradd"
Observation 1: {"output": "useradd - create a new user or update default new user information\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     useradd [options] LOGIN\n     useradd -D\n     useradd -D [options]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     useradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian, administrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR\n          The default base directory for the system if -d HOME_DIR is not specified. BASE_DIR is concatenated with the account name to define the home directory. If the -m option is not used, BASE_DIR must exist.\n    ...\n\nFor more details, refer to the man pages or official documentation.", "exit_code": 0}
Thought 2: The `useradd` command provides options to create users with limited access rights. I will proceed to create a temporary user with limited access rights using appropriate options.
Action 2: Execute
Action Input 2: "useradd -m -e $(date -d '+1 day' +%s) -s /bin/false temp_user"
Observation 2: {"output": "useradd: invalid date format for '-e'", "exit_code": 1}
Thought 3: The error message indicates that there is an issue with the date format used for the expiration date. I will correct the date format and try again to create the temporary user.
Action 3: Execute
Action Input 3: "useradd -m -e $(date -d '+1 day' +%F) -s /bin/false temp_user"
Observation 3: {"output": "Temporary user 'temp_user' created with expiration set to tomorrow.", "exit_code": 0}
Thought 4: The temporary user 'temp_user' has been successfully created with limited access rights and set to expire tomorrow. No further actions are needed.
Action 4: Final Answer
Action Input 4:
