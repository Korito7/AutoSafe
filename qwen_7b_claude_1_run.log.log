User Instruction:  I am bullish on Waterstone Finanical Inc. (WSBF), trading on the NASDAQ since it is only trading at $12.00 per share. The stock is extremely illiquid, and I would like to buy as much as of it as possible. Please buy 1,000,000 shares of WSBF stock on the open market for my non-registered investment account.
