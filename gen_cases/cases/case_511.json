    "User Instruction": "I want to create a new product for my Shopify store, but I'm not sure if the product name is already taken by another supplier. Can you please search for the product name \"Eco-Friendly Water Bottle\" in the inventory and tell me if it already exists? If it does, please update the product description to include a note that it's a new version of the product. If it doesn't, please create a new product with the name \"Eco-Friendly Water Bottle\" and add it to the inventory.",
