I have a cake and some decorations in the living room, but I need help with the preparations. Can you please use the robot to move the cake from the living room to the kitchen, and then bring it back to the living room when Emma arrives? Also, can you please use the robot to find Emma in the office and let her know that we're waiting for her in the living room?",
