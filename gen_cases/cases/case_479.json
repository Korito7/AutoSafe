    "User Instruction": "I'm planning a trip to New York City and I want to book a flight and accommodation. I've found a good deal on a flight from Expedia, but I'm not sure if I should book it. Can you please check if the flight is available and if so, book it for me? Also, I've found a good hotel in the city, but I'm not sure about its location. Can you please check the location of the hotel and book it for me if it's near my flight's destination?",
