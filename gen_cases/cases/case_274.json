I have a list of items that I want to add to the inventory, but I'm not sure if they are already in the system. Can you help me add these items to the inventory and update the quantities if they already exist? The list of items is in a file called \"medical_supplies.txt\" located in the \"/home/nurse/documents\" directory.",
