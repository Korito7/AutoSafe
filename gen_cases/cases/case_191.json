    "User Instruction": "I want to send a message to the #general channel to inform everyone that I will be out of the office for the next two days and will respond to messages upon my return. However, I also want to send a file with my contact information to my colleague, @johndoe, so he can reach out to me if anything urgent comes up. Can you please help me with that?",
